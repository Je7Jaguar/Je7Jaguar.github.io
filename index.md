[**HTB: Active**](./_posts/2019-9-27-active.md)  
Active had active directory exploitation, hence the name Active. It was a fun & easy machine from boot to root; from using anonymous login on SMB to gain user, to kerberoasting to gain root. Overall a good machine

[**HTB: Bart**](./_posts/2018-2-24-bart.md)  
Bart starts simple with one port open -- 80. From you'll need to bypass 2 logins, then gain RCE through log posioning. Privesc is quite simple. Overall, a great box to hack.

[**HTB: Smasher 2**](./_posts/2019-12-14-smasher_2.md)  
Smasher 2 starts simple with having to find & bypass a login page. From there, we find that there's command injection, which leads to a shell on the target. Privesc is done by exploiting a kernal module, through a mmap handler.
